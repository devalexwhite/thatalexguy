![RSS feed support in BookLeaf](./featured.png "Two bookmarks showing when their RSS feeds were last updated")

I've released initial support for RSS feeds in BookLeaf! With this first pass, BookLeaf will now automatically discover RSS feeds for a website when you create a bookmark. BookLeaf will then check the feeds twice a day, and use that information to show you when a site was last updated (with a link out to the latest post).

This is just the first pass of RSS in BookLeaf. Here's what's still to come:

- [ ] Ability to view all posts for RSS feeds
- [ ] Ability to turn off specific RSS feeds for a bookmark
- [ ] Ability to sort bookmarks by those recently updated

Hope you like this quick update, and as always, send any feedback or suggestions my way!
