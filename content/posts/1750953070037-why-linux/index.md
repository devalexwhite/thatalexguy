## Not my First Penguin Rodeo

I've been using Linux on and off since I was a teenager. I used to burn copies of Damn Small Linux to CD-Rs and boot them at the library (since my family used Macs that couldn't run it). Throughout college I experimented with Ubuntu servers or occasionally multi-booting a Linux distro on my laptop. I was always curious and interested in Linux, but never managed to make it stick as my daily driver.

## Making the Switch

This past year was a bit different, and I think the Asahi project was to thank. I had tried out Asahi on my M1 MacBook Pro a few times before, but always ran into some issue that made my system unusable. Near the start of this year, I decided to give it another go, knowing I'd probably regret it (last time I messed up so bad I soft bricked my machine). I installed the new(ish) Asahi Fedora Remix and started daily driving it. And this time, it's been perfect. Completely stable, nearly everything but suspend works.
