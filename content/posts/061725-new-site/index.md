I've finally given Hugo a try, and this is the result, my new personal website! Hosted on Github sites, static generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and built around the seriously incredible [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page/).

## My plans for this site

I want this to finally be "the site". Almost every year like clockwork I end up building and launching a new website for myself, and because of that I don't have a long running history of my posts. So this is it, built to last for years (decades), with the intention for design/features/layout to change, but the core to stay the same.

## Why Hugo?

I have a few simple requirements, and Hugo + Blowfish met them all:

- Powered by Markdown: I love writing in Markdown with NeoVim, and Markdown is an eternal format that can be lifted and shifted to others tools (if Hugo is ever abandoned/acquired by some shitty tech company that ruins it).

- Mine: I've been playing with the __amazing__ [BearBlog](https://bearblog.dev/) lately, and while it's a seriously incredible piece of software, I just couldn't shake the feeling that I need something that's truly mine to hack on. I'm a dev after all, it's hard to hand the keys over to someone else!

- Fast: I hate slow loading, over-engineered sites, so a slim, static site is the only path for me.

That's it, the start of something that will (hopefully) be around for quite awhile. Let me know if you like it, always feel free to [email me](mailto:alex.white@hey.com).

Peace!
