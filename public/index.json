Hosted on Github sites, static generated with Hugo and built around the seriously incredible Blowfish theme .\nMy plans for this site # I want this to finally be \u0026ldquo;the site\u0026rdquo;. Almost every year like clockwork I end up building and launching a new website for myself, and because of that I don\u0026rsquo;t have a long running history of my posts. So this is it, built to last for years (decades), with the intention for design/features/layout to change, but the core to stay the same.\nWhy Hugo? # I have a few simple requirements, and Hugo + Blowfish met them all:\nPowered by Markdown: I love writing in Markdown with NeoVim, and Markdown is an eternal format that can be lifted and shifted to others tools (if Hugo is ever abandoned/acquired by some shitty tech company that ruins it).\nMine: I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing with the amazing BearBlog lately, and while it\u0026rsquo;s a seriously incredible piece of software, I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t shake the feeling that I need something that\u0026rsquo;s truly mine to hack on. I\u0026rsquo;m a dev after all, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to hand the keys over to someone else!\nFast: I hate slow loading, over-engineered sites, so a slim, static site is the only path for me.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it, the start of something that will (hopefully) be around for quite awhile. Let me know if you like it, always feel free to email me .\nPeace!\n","date":"17 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/061725-new-site/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"New Blog","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"17 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/news/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"News","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"17 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"17 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m Alex.
